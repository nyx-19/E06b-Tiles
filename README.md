# E06b-Tiles
This program contains a tiles file that I opened through the tiles aplication and created a level using the provided sprites. There are colletable coins in the level that you must platform to get and reach the end. My character was too large for the level I made, so instead of redoing the level, I sized him down and changed his speed a bit so he wouldn't be so slow.
